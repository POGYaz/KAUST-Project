# KAUST AI Summer Project: Jarir Recommendation Systems

This repository hosts the collaborative work for the **Jarir Recommendation System**, developed as part of the KAUST AI Summer Program. It serves as a central space for **source control**, **resource sharing**, and **contributing improvements** to the project codebase.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Jarir Recommendation System aims to build an intelligent model that suggests relevant products to customers based on their preferences and browsing behavior. The project involves:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering (if we receive the data...)
- Training and evaluation of recommendation algorithms
- Model deployment and integration (hopefully 🤲)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop state-of-the-art recommendation models
- Experiment with different machine learning techniques
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Collaborate effectively to iterate on ideas and code
